squirrelmail-postini
Postini Plugin for SquirrelMail
====================

squirrelmail-postini is a very, very simple plugin that merely adds
a link to the right frame's menu line:  "Postini Message Center",
pointing to https://login.postini.com.  If you'd like to see some
more sophisticated integration with the Postini service, I'd love
to hear your ideas.


## Requirements

This should work with any SquirrelMail version I've encountered
(1.2, 1.4, & 1.5, at least).


## Features

* Adds a "Postini Message Center" link to the right frame's menu line,
  pointing to https://login.postini.com.
* Respects any translations that may be installed by the SquirrelMail
  translation team.


## Installation

* Simply enable the "postini" plugin through conf.pl.  No configuration
  is necessary.
* See the file "INSTALL" for a detailed guide.


## Questions and support

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me through
shaug-sqml @ wumpus.org.  I do have some experience writing to
Postini's XML API and would be happy to consider any features that
you might be interested in.

## Wishlist

Giving users counts of the messages in their quarantine directories?
